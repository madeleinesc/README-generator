  # Description
  It is extremely important to have a professional README file attached whenever creating a new project on Github. A README file details what the project/app is, how and what it is used for as well as how to install it or report any issues. This README generator makes sure that every new project has a README attached that includes all the necessities the user will need when looking at your project.
